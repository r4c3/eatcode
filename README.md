EatCode is a food-themed SWE technical interview training website. Unlike competitors LeetCode (ðŸ¤®), HackerRank (ðŸ’©), and CodeSignal (ðŸ¤¥), our site gives users an immersive experience with our food-themed DSA problems, unique UI, and faster solution testing. This project was developed in association with WebDev @ GT.

I'm picking this project back up and am working to deploy it to [eatcode.dev](https://eatcode.dev).

## User-facing Features
- Sort problems by name, difficulty, status (solved/started), tags (greedy/math/etc).
- User accounts via Google Auth to track progress and collect Beef.
- Submit solutions in C++, Java, or Python.
## Technical Features
- Distributed worker network to containerize and run user submissions (see [dexter](https://github.com/eatcoders/dexter)).
- Admin workflow for creating new problems and auto-generating test cases and related wrappers (see [test-case-factory](https://github.com/eatcoders/test-case-factory)).
