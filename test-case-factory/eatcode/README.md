EatCode is a food-themed SWE technical interview training website. Unlike competitors LeetCode (ü§Æ), HackerRank (üí©), and CodeSignal (ü§•), our site gives users an immersive experience with our food-themed DSA problems, 3D UI, and colloquially faster solution testing. This project was developed in association with WebDev @ GT.
